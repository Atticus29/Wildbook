        <h2>Overview</h2>
            
          <p>The Polar Bear Photo-identification Library is a visual database of polar bear (<em>Ursus maritimus</em>) encounters and of individually catalogued polar bears. The library is maintained and used by biologists to collect and analyze polar bear encounter data to learn more about the behavior and movements of this threatened species. The Library uses photographs of the polar bear's facial profile (left or right side) to distinguish among individuals based on whisker spot patterns and scars. Customized image pattern recognition software developed using computer vision techniques allow rapid identification of individual polar bears. </p>
<p>You can assist with polar bear research by submitting photos and sighting information. The information you submit will be used in studies on polar bear populations to help understand and conserve this species.<br/>
