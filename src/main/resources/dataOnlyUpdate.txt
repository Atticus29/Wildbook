Hello! 

Just a quick e-mail to let you know that your wmanta ray encounter report has been classified as DATA-ONLY in the ECOCEAN MantaMatcher. This status indicates that we do not believe that we have enough data from the photographs submitted to identify this manta again in the future or from past observations. However, the data you submitted could still be very useful to the research community and will be retained.

If you have additional photographs that may be useful in helping us to identify this animal, please send them to webmaster@mantamatcher.org and reference the encounter number listed below. Photos of the ventral (bottom) side patterning can help us accurately identify each individual. You can learn more about the types of photographs that are useful for manta mark-recapture at:

Thanks again for your manta encounter report. We appreciate your effort to help us better understand and protect this amazing animal!

Sincerely,
Zaven Arzoumanian
President, ECOCEAN USA
