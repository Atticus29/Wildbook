Hello!

Just a quick e-mail to let you know that the manta ray encounter that you submitted has been MATCHED to a previously identified manta in the ECOCEAN MantaMatcher.

This information is important to unlock some of the mystery surrounding these highly migratory animals.


Thanks again for your input.
