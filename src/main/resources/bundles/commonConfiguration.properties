htmlDescription=The Polar Bear Photo-identification Library is a visual database of polar bear (Ursus maritimus) encounters and of individually catalogued polar bears. The library is maintained and used by biologists to collect and analyze polar bear encounter data to learn more about the behavior and movements of this threatened species.
