#Creating bootstrap files

If you make changes to ```config.json``` go to ```http://getbootstrap.com/customize/``` and upload the config.json file and recompiles/download bootstrap. This will be a zip file. Unzip it. Copy ```css/bootstrap.css``` to overwrite the _bootstrap.less ile found here. Do the same for ```css/bootstrap-theme.css``` overwriting _bootstrap-theme.less.
